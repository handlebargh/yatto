Older versions will not receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reports of potential security issues are welcome - for example:

- Any other way the applicationâ€™s functionality could be abused.

If you discover a vulnerability:

1. **Do not** open a public GitHub issue.
2. Please report security vulnerabilities via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/handlebargh/yatto/security/advisories/new)

   - A description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Any relevant logs, error messages, or proof-of-concept code

If you report a valid vulnerability and would like to be publicly acknowledged, please let me know.
I will credit you in the security section of the release notes, unless you request to remain anonymous.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please give me reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure.
